This code scrapes information on the annual EGU General Assembly held in Vienna from 23 to 28 April.

This Python code does the following:

Imports necessary libraries such as requests, re, BeautifulSoup, selenium, traceback, csv, sys, time, and tqdm.
Sends a request to a specific URL to get the HTML content of the page.
Uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content and extract all the div tags with the class "form-check".
Filters out the div tags that do not have a numeric value and appends the values to a list.
Initializes a Chrome web driver using Selenium.
Clicks on each checkbox element corresponding to the values in the list obtained in step 4 and appends the resulting URL to a list.
Gets the HTML content of each URL in the resulting list and uses Beautiful Soup to extract all the div elements with the class "co_mto_programme-session-block-title active" and the corresponding hyperlink.
Appends all the hyperlinks to a list.
Scrapes data from each hyperlink using Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and other libraries such as Undetected-chromedriver and tqdm.
Writes the scraped data to a CSV file named "Sessions_EGU2023.csv".
